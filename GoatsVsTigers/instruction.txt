				INSTRUCTION

 Goats vs tigers  is a strategic, two-player board game. 
 The game is asymmetric in that one player controls four tigers and the other 
 player controls up to twenty goats. The tigers 'hunt' the goats while 
 the goats attempt to block the tigers' movements.
 Directions of valid movement between these points are connected by lines. 
 The game play takes place in two phases. In the first phase the goats 
 are placed on the board while the tigers are moved. In the second phase both 
 the goats and the tigers are moved. For the tigers, the objective 
 is to "capture" five goats to win. The goats win by blocking all the tigers 
 legal moves. In case where all goats are blocked, tigers win.
 If You want to move, just type the pawn coordinate which You would like to go 
 (in case of tigers, or after 20 goats were placed), and coordinates of fields 
 You'd like to go to. In case of placing goats, just type the coordinate once.
 Typical game consists of 2 parts. After 1 part players swaps pawns.
